The NewsGrid website template:
The NewsGrid is a very elegant and visually attractive HTML/CSS template that leverages the power of the CSS variables and grid display, its design is perfect fit for news or blog type websites.
For this project's "article intros" I decided to implement the same semantical HTML markup, while making use of the CSS grid display rules to make it appear as if they had different markup structures.

Technologies /Fameworks Included In the project:
- HTML
- CSS
- Fontawesome 5
